      - Explain the distinction between public, protected and private attributes.
   - **Implementing Encapsulation**

    - Example: Overloading the `+` operator to combine the goals of two `FootballPlayer` instances.
  - **Comprehensive List of Magic Methods**: Provide an overview of various magic methods for comparison, arithmetic operations, and container behaviors.
    - Example: Using `__add__`, `__lt__` (less than), `__eq__` (equal to), and `__getitem__` for a class representing a team.

### 11. Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and Interface Definition üõ°Ô∏è
  - **Why Use ABCs?**: Understand the role of abstract base classes in defining interfaces and enforcing subclass implementation.
    - Example: Defining an `Athlete` ABC with an abstract `train` method.
  - **Creating and Using ABCs**: Learn to use the `abc` module to create abstract classes and abstract methods.
    - Example: Implementing an `Athlete` class that cannot be instantiated and requires subclasses to implement the `train` method.
